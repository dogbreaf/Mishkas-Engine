# Mishkas Engine

This project is in a very unfinished state (Although if the code happens
to be functional at any given moment I think there is enough functionality
to maybe do something actually interesting).

Obviously there are much better game engines for this purpose but I wanted
to make my own, just to enjoy the challenges and process even if doing so
isnt super worth-while.

This is one of the biggest most complicated projects I have worked on and 
includes some old code of mine, so some of it is probably not very good or
doesn't make sense but my main concern at this point is not go get bogged
down in the details and just try to keep things relatively simple and fast.

## Build instructions
To build the project on windows or linux, just pass the main source file to
fbc, e.g.:
```bash
$ fbc game.bas
$ fbc edit2.bas
```
