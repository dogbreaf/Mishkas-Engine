This project is in a very unfinished state (Although if the code happens
to be functional I think there is enough functionality to maybe do something
actually interesting).

This is one of the biggest most complicated projects I have worked on and 
includes some old code of mine so some of it is probably not very good or
doesnt make sense but my main concern at this point is not go get bogged
down in the details and just try to keep things relatively simple and fast.
